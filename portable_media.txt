Although I don't have pictures, and this wasnt exactly code,
I made a portable media center with a gaming station with a Li-po battery
as well as the Raspberry Pi and a Hypixel Display. I used a small keyboard to 
control the unit. I could stream videos and play games, unfortunately I didn't have
the guts to download any torrents!
