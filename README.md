So, this is just a mumbo jumbo of files that I've made - some for robotics competitions, some for hackathons, and some of them 
are just personal side projects. It isn't the most ideal scenario, but so far, I'm just a junior at coding, so when I get more
files, I'll be sure to compartmentalize.


Some of these like megapin and the robotics plan might look weird, but they're actually plans for the asia pacific round in japan.

I have a lot of ongoing arduino projects and Iot projects I havent uploaded yet, but I will do so in a bit. The plane plane is just one of them, where I plane to make a flying wing capable of high flight time.
